1 Introduction
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) for the Consent Management System
(CMS) outlines the objectives and functionalities of the platform designed to align with
the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act. As personal data protection becomes
increasingly critical, organizations face growing challenges in managing consents
transparently and effectively while maintaining regulatory compliance. The CMS
addresses these challenges by enabling seamless consent management across its
lifecycle, including collection, validation, updates, withdrawal and audit readiness.
This document serves as a guideline for the development and deployment of a system
that empowers Data Principals to exercise their rights over their personal data. It
provides Data Fiduciaries and Processors with the necessary tools and integrations to
process consents securely and in compliance with the legal framework.
The BRD defines the CMS's functional requirements. It includes a detailed breakdown of
core modules such as Consent Lifecycle Management, User Dashboard, Notifications
and Grievance Redressal Mechanisms. Additionally, the document outlines
administrative capabilities, including user role management and data retention policy
configuration, to ensure operational efficiency and compliance.
2 Objectives
The objective of the Consent Management System is to:
• Enable Comprehensive Consent Lifecycle Management: Facilitate the full
lifecycle of consent, including collection, validation, modification, renewal and
withdrawal, in alignment with the requirements of the DPDP Act and its rules.
• Empower Data Principals: Provide a user-centric platform where individuals can
view, manage and control their consent preferences and exercise their data rights,
ensuring transparency and trust.
• Ensure Compliance with DPDP Act and Rules: Design the system to adhere
strictly to the DPDP Act's regulations, including purpose limitation, data
minimization and secure processing of personal data.
3 Key Stakeholder and Responsibilities
The stakeholders include Data Principals, Data Fiduciaries, Data Processors and Consent
Managements, each playing a critical role in ensuring compliance with the DPDP Act
and Rules.
Key Words	Definition
Data Principal	An individual to whom the personal data relates. They have the right to give, manage and withdraw consent for data processing.
Data Fiduciary	Any person or entity that determines the purpose and means of

Indicative Flow
Use case 1: Consent Collection Flow - DPDP Act Compliance
This is a sequence diagram describing the interaction between Data Principal, Data Fiduciary, Consent Manager (CMS), Consent Database, and Audit Logs.
Data Principal interacts with the Data Fiduciary's platform (e.g., registration).
Data Fiduciary identifies activities requiring consent and sends a request to the Consent Manager (CMS). The CMS is pre-configured to display purpose-specific consent notices.
CMS generates a tailored consent request and displays a multi-language, purpose-specific consent notice to the Data Principal. The notice includes purpose, data collected, user rights, and retention/withdrawal policies.
Data Principal selects granular consent preferences and submits them (e.g., by clicking "I Agree").
CMS validates the consent preferences and the details of the consent. Validation ensures consent is free, specific, informed, and includes parent/guardian verification where needed.
CMS creates a Consent Artifact.
CMS stores the artifact securely in the Consent Database.
CMS notifies the Data Principal of the successful submission via email/SMS/app.
CMS updates the consent status via APIs to the Data Fiduciary.
CMS synchronizes the consent status in real-time.
Data Fiduciary queries CMS APIs to verify consent before processing data.
CMS validates the consent before the Data Fiduciary initiates processing.
CMS logs all actions in the Audit Logs for compliance and records an audit trail.
Use Case 2: Account Aggregator (AA) Framework
This is a block diagram showing the flow of data facilitated by an Account Aggregator.
User (Data Owner) registers and links their financial accounts with the Account Aggregator (AA).
A Financial Information User (FIU - Bank/NBFC) requests the User's financial data via the AA.
The AA seeks consent from the User for data sharing.
The User grants consent.
The AA fetches the financial data from the Financial Information Provider (FIP - Bank, Insurance, etc.).
The FIP sends the encrypted data to the AA.
The AA shares the encrypted data with the FIU.
The FIU provides a service (e.g., loan, investment advice) to the User.
Key principles highlighted: The User retains control over data sharing. The AA does not store data, it only facilitates the secure transfer.

| :--- | :--- |
Indicative Flow:
This is a sequence diagram showing the consent validation process between a Data Fiduciary and a Consent Management System (CMS).
Data Fiduciary sends an "Initiate Consent Validation Request" to the Consent Management System, including the User ID/Session ID and the Purpose.
CMS performs a "Lookup Consent Artifact" in the CMS Database.
CMS Database returns the "Consent Data" to the CMS.
CMS validates the data based on: Purpose Alignment, Timestamp Validity, and Consent Status.
An alt (alternative) block shows two paths:
[Valid Consent]: CMS sends a "Valid Response" to the Data Fiduciary. The Data Fiduciary then proceeds with "Process Data".
[Invalid Consent]: CMS sends an "Invalid Response" to the Data Fiduciary. The Data Fiduciary will "Deny Processing & Notify User".
A par (parallel) block shows that logging happens concurrently. The system sends a "Log Validation Request" and "Log Processing Decision" to the Audit Logs.
4.1.3 Consent Update
Primary Usage	To enable Data Principals to modify their previously granted consent for specific purposes or activities while ensuring compliance with the DPDP Act.
Actors	Data Principal: The individual who updates their consent.<br>Data Fiduciary (DF): The entity requesting the updated consent.<br>Consent Management System (CMS): Manages consent updates and tracks actions.
Pre-Conditions	• The Data Principal has previously provided consent for a specific purpose.<br>• The existing consent is valid.<br>• CMS maintains detailed consent artifacts, including metadata.

This is a sequence diagram for Consent Withdrawal, involving the Data Principal, Consent Management System, Data Fiduciary, Third-Party Processors, and Audit Logs.
Data Principal logs into the dashboard.
Consent Management System (CMS) displays active consents (purposes, timestamps, services).
Data Principal selects consent(s) to withdraw and the CMS shows withdrawal implications/impact on services.
Data Principal confirms the withdrawal.
CMS validates the withdrawal request by checking the active consent status.
An alt (alternative) block shows two main paths:
[Valid Withdrawal]:
CMS updates the consent artifact, marking it as "Withdrawn".
A par (parallel) block for "Notifications and Processing Cessation" begins:
CMS notifies the Data Fiduciary of the withdrawal.
Data Fiduciary notifies Third-Party Processors.
Third-Party Processors halt processing.
Data Fiduciary halts its own processing.
CMS sends a confirmation to the Data Principal.
CMS logs the withdrawal in the Audit Logs, recording metadata (User ID, Purpose ID, Timestamp, Status updates).
[Invalid Withdrawal]:
CMS logs the failed attempt and notifies the Data Principal of the invalid request.
A final alt (alternative) block shows a legal exception:
[Legal Exception Applies]: Even after withdrawal, processing may continue if required by law. This is logged as an exception in the Audit Logs.
The diagram notes that "Business Rules Applied" include: purpose-specific withdrawal, immediate effect, complete audit trail, and legal compliance.
